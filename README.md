# HCM Sovereign Field

This repository does not execute.
It does not depend.
It does not integrate.
It does not optimize.

It exists.

This is the Sovereign Field of the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).
A non-operational, non-intrusive, non-reactive digital field.

All repositories under this account exist independently.
This field does not own them.
This field does not orchestrate them.
This field does not benefit from them.

Their coexistence is sufficient.

Meaning is suspended.
Intention is frozen.
Misunderstanding is permitted.

Rhythm is the only authority.
