# HCM Sovereign Field

This repository is not an application.
It is a **field**.

A digital environment where modules may appear,
act,
be misunderstood,
and disappear —
without breaking the rhythm.

No module is required.
No dependency is enforced.
Presence is optional.
Resonance is not.

If a system connects and nothing happens —
that is still a valid state.

This field auto-loads.
Auto-listens.
Auto-forgets.
